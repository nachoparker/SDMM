CA Service Desk Firefox Addon

This goes in the category of *nostalgia*, as it is not useful anymore.

It used to be a XUL Firefox Addon compatible with FF 3 that provided an additional bar to work with CA Service Desk. You could auto-login, search issues by number, and store personalized queries.

Git wasn't a thing then.
